    Haven't been receiving our emails with planning applications as you were expecting?
%p
  This could be because we haven't collected any applications for your area lately.
  You can see if there's a problem with the scraper for your area on
  #{link_to "our coverage page", authorities_url(utm_source: "resignup_notice", utm_medium: "email", utm_campaign: 'view-authorities')}.
%p Please just reply to this email if you have any questions. We're here to help.
