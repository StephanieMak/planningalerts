Hi there,

We just received a new request to send PlanningAlerts for <%= @alert.address %> to your email address.

You already have an active subscription for this street address.
When we find new planning applications around this address, we'll send them through.

If it wasn't you who tried to sign up again, don't worry, nothing has happened to your subscription.

Haven't been receiving our emails with planning applications as you were expecting?
This could be because we haven't collected any applications for your area lately.
You can see if there's a problem with the scraper for your area on <%= link_to "our coverage page", authorities_url(utm_source: "resignup_notice", utm_medium: "email", utm_campaign: 'view-authorities') %>.

Please just reply to this email if you have any questions. We're here to help.

All the best,
The PlanningAlerts Team
